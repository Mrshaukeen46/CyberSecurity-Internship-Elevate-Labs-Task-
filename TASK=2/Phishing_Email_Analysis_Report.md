## Phishing Indicators Identified

1. **Sender Address Spoofing**
   - The sender address (`support@secure-accounts.com`) does not match the official domain of the service.
   - Display name is generic (“Support Team”).

2. **Header Discrepancies**
   - `Return-Path` differs from `From` address.
   - `Received` headers show the email originated from an unrelated server (checked with [MxToolbox Email Header Analyzer](https://mxtoolbox.com/EmailHeaders.aspx)).

3. **Suspicious Links**
   - Visible link text appears legitimate, but hovering shows a mismatched or suspicious URL.
   - The domain is not the official domain.

4. **Attachment**
   - Unexpected attachment: `Account_Verification_Form.docx`.
   - Attachments in unsolicited emails are a common malware delivery method.

5. **Urgent or Threatening Language**
   - Phrases like “Failure to act within 24 hours will result in permanent account closure” pressure the recipient.

6. **Mismatched URLs**
   - Hyperlink text and actual URL do not match.

7. **Spelling/Grammar Errors**
   - “spe ling” error found (deliberately included for demonstration).
   - Minor grammatical awkwardness (“Failure to act…”).

8. **General Traits**
   - Lack of personalization (uses “Dear user”).
   - No official branding or contact details.
